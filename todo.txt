    - calibrate before every scan; consider having the grid on a stand
      behind the subject
    - don't move around the room

- see if I can have the keyboard handler draw several frames
    - it will then do a full iteration
    - display handler will draw a warning grid
    - self.start_timer resets the last_frame and dropped_frames
    - self.tick waits for the next frame
    - blast red as soon as it drops a frame

- use 3 digit binary for status codes:
    4 -> error
    1 to 7 can be start/stop of various things
        2, 1 for gray
        3, 5 for binary
        6, 7 for grids
        block of 4 if there was an error

- framework for animating things with pauses for user input
    - base object should be animatable
    - list of python functions, pausing for user between each
    - somehow representing tweens

        - objects which update the attributes of the object, which then draws itself
